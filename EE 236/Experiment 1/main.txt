Overview of the experiment
Aim of the experiment

To measure voltage across capacitor aginst square wave voltage of different
frequecies.

1.2

Methods

In your own words, describe how you set out to realize the goal of the experiment. Only 1 paragraph of a brief overview of your approach is expected
here. Do not list your observations here. I used

Design

In this section, explain your design strategy for the experiment.Mention all
the design steps you follow for each part of the experiment.An equation based
analysis, with supporting circuit diagrams is expected. Circuit diagrams
must be made in Xcircuit.
